# Plotting Twin Peaks: The Return

I decided to take the coordinates listed at the bottom of [Link](http://thesearchforthezone.com/) and run them through the Folium, which uses Python and Leaflet.js maps. 

To view:

- clone the repo
- open a terminal and run the script `python twinpeaks.py`
- enjoy!
