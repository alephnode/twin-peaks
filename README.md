# Plotting Twin Peaks: The Return

I decided to take the coordinates listed at the bottom of [William Hasting's conspiracy site](http://thesearchforthezone.com/) and run them through Folium, which uses Python and Leaflet.js maps. 

To view:

- clone the repo
- open a terminal and run the script `python twinpeaks.py`
  -  Note: you must run the script in a python environment with folium installed
- launch tp.html in a web browser
- enjoy!
